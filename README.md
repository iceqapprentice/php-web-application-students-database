# php-web-application-students-database
Web application made in PHP, combined with MySQL. You can add new entrys-students, search for them, or delete them from database. There is an option where you can insert new students to database. 
This is an application that I made in my free time, for the purpose of learning PHP and MySQL. It has simple UI.
Connection with databse is made in procedural ways. I am planning to make an update of this app that will include connecting with database using OOP(Objective Oriented Programming) concepts.
