# php-web-application-students-database
Web application made in PHP, combined with MySQL. You can add new entrys-students, search for them, or delete them from database.
This is an application that I made in my free time, for the purpose of learning PHP and MySQL. 
It has a simple UI.
Connection with databse is made in procedural ways. I am planning to make an update of this app that will include connecting with database using OOP(Objective Oriented Programming) concepts. Also, there will be an update of web UI that will be adjusted with contemporary design rules.
